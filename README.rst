FredIRC
=======
FredIRC is an event-driven Python framework for
`IRC (Internet Relay Chat) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_
bots. It aims to provide a high-level abstraction of
`IRC's internals <http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2812>`_, an easy-to-use API
and convinient utilities related to bot development.

FredIRC is open source and distributed under terms of the
`BSD 2-Clause license <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause>`_.

**Note:**  This project is still in early development. A first release is well
on the way.
